# Theory of Resonant Spatial Encoding of Information

## Abstract

This theory introduces a physical mechanism for storing information in the form of *stable spatial configurations* of a medium, created by standing electromagnetic or acoustic waves in resonant volumes.
Information is stored not in the instantaneous waveform, but in the **material structure** that persists after the external excitation is removed.
Such storage is *energy-independent*, *volumetric*, and *topologically stable*.

## Key Definitions

**Information** — a topologically stable spatial configuration of material parameters.

**Resonant form** — a stationary spatial distribution of a medium’s properties corresponding to an eigenmode of a standing wave within a bounded domain.

**Encoding** — the transition from an initially undifferentiated state to a resonant form under wave excitation.

**Memory** — the ability of a medium to retain the encoded form after the external excitation ceases.

## Axiom of Resonant Encoding

Chaos is a set of all possible forms.
A wave selects and stabilizes one form.
Matter preserves the selected form.

**Therefore:**
Information = **form stabilized in matter by a resonant wave process**.

## 1. Chaos as a state of latent informational capacity

Chaos is not disorder; rather, it is a state containing **all potential configurations** of the system without a mechanism to distinguish among them.

Let ( \Omega ) be the space of possible spatial configurations:

[
\Omega = { M(r) \mid M: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R} }
]

Before wave excitation, no configuration is preferred.

## 2. Wave excitation as the form-selection operator

In a resonant cavity, a standing wave constrains the system to a discrete set of stable eigenmodes:

[
I(r) = |E_1 + E_2|^2 = I_0 \cos^2(k r + \phi)
]

The wave **selects** a structure by **imposing spatial organization**.

Wave = **selection operator**
[
\Psi: \Omega \rightarrow M(r)
]

## 3. Matter as a medium of structural fixation

A responsive medium (e.g., GST, GSST, silica, photopolymer, or crystalline lattice) undergoes structural changes proportional to the spatial intensity pattern:

[
\Delta n(r),\ \Delta \rho(r),\ \Delta S(r)
]

where

* ( \Delta n(r) ) — refractive index modification
* ( \Delta \rho(r) ) — density modulation
* ( \Delta S(r) ) — degree of local structural ordering

Once structural relaxation ends, the pattern remains:

[
\frac{\partial M(r,t)}{\partial t} = 0 \quad \text{for } t > t_\text{excitation}
]

This condition defines **memory stability**.

## 4. Dynamical model of encoding

The evolution of the stored structure can be written as:

[
\frac{\partial M(r,t)}{\partial t} = F(I(r,t), M(r,t))
]

A **stable encoded state** is obtained when:

[
F(I=0, M) = 0
]

i.e., the structure persists **without energy input**.

## 5. Universality of the principle

| Scale     | Wave Process             | Resulting Structure       |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Cosmology | Acoustic plasma modes    | Cosmic web topology       |
| Acoustics | Standing waves in matter | Chladni figures           |
| Optics    | Coherent interference    | Holographic patterns      |
| Photonics | Resonant cavity fields   | Volumetric optical memory |

**General principle:**
*Waves organize matter into stable forms.*

## 6. Volumetric Photonic Memory (Applied Case)

* Writing: resonant optical field induces spatial structural modification.
* Storage: structural configuration remains without power.
* Reading: low-power probe retrieves the form without altering it.

Estimated storage density:
[
1–10 \ \text{petabytes per cubic centimeter}
]

Energy required for storage retention:
[
\approx 0
]

## 7. Core Statement

Chaos contains forms.
The wave selects a form.
Matter preserves the form.
**Information is form.**
