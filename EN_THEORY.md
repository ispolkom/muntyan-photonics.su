# Theory of Resonant Spatial Encoding of Information

## Abstract
This theory describes a mechanism for storing information as stable spatial configurations of a medium formed under the influence of standing waves of light or sound within enclosed volumes.  
Information is not stored in the ongoing signal itself, but in the **material form** that arises as a result of the wave process and remains stable after the signal is removed.

## Axiom of Resonant Encoding
Chaos is a set of undefined forms.  
The wave selects and structures a form.  
Matter remembers and holds the selected form.

**Therefore:**  
Information is a **form** stabilized in matter by a wave process.

---

## 1. Chaos as a space of possible structures
Chaos is not disorder.  
Chaos is a state of maximal informational potential, in which all configurations of the system are present, but none is distinguished.

Chaos = a space of forms awaiting selection.

---

## 2. The wave as a mechanism of selection
A standing wave in an enclosed volume generates a set of stable spatial energy distributions:

\[
I(r) = |E_1 + E_2|^2 = I_0 \cos^2(k r + \phi)
\]

The wave **selects** a specific form from the set of possible ones.

Wave = operator of form selection.

## 3. Matter as the carrier of form
A photosensitive or structurally adaptive medium (quartz, photopolymer, GST, liquid, gas, crystal) **fixes** the selected configuration:

\[
\Delta n(r),\ \Delta \rho(r),\ \Delta S(r)
\]

where  
- \( \Delta n(r) \) — change in refractive index,  
- \( \Delta \rho(r) \) — change in density,  
- \( \Delta S(r) \) — change in structural order.

After the wave is removed, the form remains.

Matter = memory of form.

## 4. Mathematical model of structure formation
\[
\text{Chaos} \rightarrow \text{Standing wave} \rightarrow \text{Structure}
\]

\[
M(r) = \cos^2(k r + \phi)
\]

Information is encoded in the **topology** of material properties, not in the signal itself.

## 5. Universality of the principle

| Scale | Wave Process | Resulting Structure |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| Cosmology | acoustic modes in early plasma | distribution of galaxies |
| Acoustics | standing waves in liquids | Chladni patterns |
| Optics | interference of coherent light | holographic patterns |
| Photonic memory | standing waves in resonant volume | stable material configuration |

The principle is universal: **the wave organizes matter.**

---

## 6. Volumetric photonic memory as an application
- Recording is performed by a wave (light or sound).
- The structure is stored in matter.
- No energy is required to maintain storage.

Storage density: **1–10 PB/cm³**

---

## 7. Summary (core formula)
Chaos contains forms.  
The wave chooses a form.  
Matter preserves the form.
