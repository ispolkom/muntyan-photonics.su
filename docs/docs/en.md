# Part 1: Geometry and construction of spheres  
Muntyan’s Photon Sphere is a fractal system of nested spheres, each covered by a geodesic grid of pentagons and hexagons.
Each figure is a cluster that includes photon transceiver nodes.
The spheres work as a multi-layered photon neural network, where information is transmitted and received by light — wirelessly, with instantaneous feedback.

## 1.1 Architecture and relationships
- The outer layers receive signals from the outside and transmit them inward.
- The inner layers simultaneously receive and send data outward.
- Each sphere forms bidirectional photon channels, and each cluster is connected to neighboring ones, creating a spatial information transmission network.
- Light flows can represent both coherent lasers and scattered spectral signals.

## 1.2 General geometry illustration
The illustration shows multi-layered spheres, each consisting of hundreds of pentagonal and hexagonal clusters. Red rays represent optical transmission channels between layers.

## 1.3 Cluster density and geometry
Sphere level | Radius (cm) | Number of clusters (≈) | Number of connections | Function
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | 1 | 60 | ~300 | Central node, inward transmission
2 | 2 | 240 | ~1200 | Signal processing
3 | 4 | 900 | ~5400 | Summing and filtering
4 | 8 | 3600 | ~21600 | Transformation and routing
5 | 16 | 14400 | ~86400 | Outer reception/transmission

## 1.4 Cluster growth formula
The number of clusters (N_k) on a sphere of radius (r) is approximated by:  
\[ N_k = 12 + 10 \left( \frac{r}{r_0} \right)^2 \]  
where \( r_0 = 1 \text{ cm} \) is the radius of the first sphere.  
This expression describes the geometric increase in node density as the radius grows.

## 1.5 Materials and construction
- **Frame**: carbon fiber or ceramics with low thermal expansion.
- **Coating**: dielectric mirror with reflectivity > 0.98.
- **Clusters**: VCSEL micro-lasers + PIN/APD photodetectors.
- **Mounting**: coaxial suspension ensuring centering and 1–3 mm gap between layers.

Each sphere functions as an individual neuro-photon layer, and their collective structure is a 3D self-organizing computational structure.
